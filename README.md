# FriendFinder
This friend finder is an application that has a user take a survey, compares it to other people stored and gives the best overall match.
The questions I chose are all related to the user's like (or dislike) of different types of animals.

## How It Works
    * Homepage has a Take Survey button, which if clicked takes the user to a survey page.
    * The user is required to fill out a name and an email address, and then answer the 10 questions provided.
    * Once the information has been submitted, program runs through an array of people to see whick person has the closest results.
    * Then the program displays a card at the bottom to show which person best fits their answers.


## Installation
    npm install
    npm install express
    npm install path

## Known Issues
    None at this time. Assignment did request to use modals, but I was having trouble getting those to show so I used cards instead just to show that I know the basic concept of the assignment and just had issues with Bootstrap.
