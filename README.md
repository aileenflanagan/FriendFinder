# FriendFinder
This friend finder is an application that has a user take a survey, compares it to other people stored and gives the best overall match.
The questions I chose are all related to the user's like (or dislike) of different types of animals.

## How It Works
    * Homepage has a Take Survey button, which if clicked takes the user to a survey page.
    * The user is required to fill out a name and an email address, and then answer the 10 questions provided.

## Installation
    npm install
    npm install express
    npm install path
